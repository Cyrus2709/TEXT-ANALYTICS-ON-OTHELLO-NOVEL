Text Analytics on Othello Novel

Welcome to the Text Analytics on Othello Novel project! In this project, we have conducted comprehensive text analytics on William Shakespeare's famous play, "Othello." Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and tools such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Text Blob, and various Python libraries, we have performed emotion analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to gain insights into this timeless literary work.

Project Overview

Dates: October 2022 - December 2022
Technologies Used: LDA, NLTK, Text Blob, seaborn, scikit-learn, gensim
About the Project

"Othello" is one of Shakespeare's most renowned tragedies, exploring themes of jealousy, betrayal, and the destructive power of manipulation. In this project, we have delved into the text of "Othello" to extract valuable insights and understand the emotional undertones and core themes present in the play.

Key Objectives and Achievements

Emotion Analysis: We have prioritized emotion analysis by meticulously cleaning and preprocessing the text data. Using sentiment analysis tools like Text Blob, we have gained insights into the emotional sentiments expressed throughout the play.
Sentiment Analysis: The project includes sentiment analysis to understand the overall emotional tone of the text and highlight key emotional moments. We have skillfully employed text visualization techniques to present these findings in an intuitive manner.
Topic Modeling: Leveraging the LDA algorithm and various Python libraries such as NLTK, seaborn, scikit-learn, and gensim, we have conducted topic modeling to uncover the core themes within the novel. This analysis helps highlight key sentences and passages that contribute to these themes.
